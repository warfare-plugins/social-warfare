### Removed

- Removed the Pinterest character counter. Pinterest has now fixed the bug that was causing descriptions in shares to get truncated, which means that once again we no longer need to count characters.

### Added

- Add a "no_pin" class to the pin it hover button. If you add the class "no_pin" to an image, it will not get a pin hover button attached to it.

### Fixed

- Fixed the pin hover button. We refactored a couple of pieces of the JavaScript that control the hover button so it should work properly under most circumstances.
- Fixed the Really Simple SSL compatibility issue. You should now be able to use share recovery without Really Simple SSL forcing the recovery URL to be `https` when trying to recover from `http`.
