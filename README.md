## Guidelines & Standards for Creating & Updating Code on This Project

Coding Standards are an important factor for achieving a high code quality. A common visual style, naming conventions and other technical settings allow us to produce a homogenous code which is easy to read and maintain.

While this project has used various coding standards over time, this guide should provide the framework for all new code additions and to updates made to existing code.

**WordPress Coding Standards:** All WordPress coding standards should be followed. Anything not specifically defined here should defer to WordPress's recommended coding standards found here: [WordPress Coding Standards](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards).

**Variables and Class Names:** All PHP and Javascript variables, functions and classes, and CSS classes and ID's should follow the following naming standards. All names will use the Snake Case nomenclature and be preceded with the swp_ prefix (e.g. swp_my_variable_name).

**Docblocking:** Each file should begin with a docblock, as well as each function and class should be preceded with a docblock to explain it's purpose and functionality. There is no such thing as too much documentation on this project. The purpose is that any developer or non-developer should be able to easily browser each file and know exactly what is happening in that file.

## Guidelines for Submitting Issues to this GitHub Issue Tracker
Before submitting an issue to the issue tracker, please be sure of a few things. By following these guidelines, you maximize the possibility of our development team being able to find a solution to the issue in a quick and thorough manner.

### Prerequisites: Do this BEFORE submitting an issue

#### 1. Check the Documentation
First check the [support documentation](https://warfareplugins.com/support/) on the Warfare Plugins website to ensure that a solution to your issue has not already been addressed. Once you've determined that there is no useful information for your particular issue, you may proceed to step 2.

#### 2. Submit a Support Ticket First
Once you have completed step 1, you need to submit a ticket using the [contact form on the Warfare Plugins website](https://warfareplugins.com/). Once submitted, most tickets are responded to on the same or next business day so please allow until the end of the next business day for a response.

Many tickets being posted here are issues that simply require adjusting a single setting to accomodate themes or plugins in certain ways. The support team is able to respond to these much, much more quickly than here in the developer's workspace. Since this is the case, any issues submitted without first going through the support team will be deleted. Otherwise it is a waste of both your time and ours.

#### 3. Create an Issue on GitHub
Only once you have completed the above steps should you submit an issue to GitHub. GitHub is the workspace of the development team. In the rare instances where the support team is unable to solve a particular issue, it will be brought here to be tracked and solved by the development team. GitHub is public so that not only the support team, but also all users can view and track the progress of issues as well as commenting and participating in the conversation regarding each issue.

### Required Information: Provide this information WHILE submitting an issue
Once you've gone through support and you're ready to submit a GitHub issue, please **copy and paste the following information into your GitHub issue and fill out the blanks**:

#### Description of the Issue

A. Describe the nature of the issue:
